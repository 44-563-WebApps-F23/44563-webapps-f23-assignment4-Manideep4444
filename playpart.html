            HELMER.
            _[calls out from his room]_. Is that my little lark twittering out
            there?
        </p>
        <p>
            NORA.
            _[busy opening some of the parcels]_. Yes, it is!
        </p>
        <p>
            HELMER.
            Is it my little squirrel bustling about?
        </p>
        <p>
            NORA.
            Yes!
        </p>
        <p>
            HELMER.
            When did my squirrel come home?
        </p>
        <p>
            NORA.
            Just now. _[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
            mouth.]_ Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.
        </p>
        <p>
            
            HELMER.
            Don’t disturb me. _[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
            the room, pen in hand.]_ Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
            little spendthrift been wasting money again?
        </p>
        <p>
            NORA.
            Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
            This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.
